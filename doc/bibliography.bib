@article{MultipleShoot1962,
	abstract = {The common techniques for solving two-point boundary value problems can be classified
as either "shooting" or "finite difference" methods. Central to a shooting method
is the ability to integrate the differential equations as an initial value problem
with guesses for the unknown initial values. This ability is not required with a finite
difference method, for the unknowns are considered to be the values of the true solution
at a number of interior mesh points. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.
One serious shortcoming of shooting becomes apparent when, as happens altogether too
often, the differential equations are so unstable that they "blow up" before the initial
value problem can be completely integrated. This can occur even in the face of extremely
accurate guesses for the initial values. Hence, shooting seems to offer no hope for
some problems. A finite difference method does have a chance for it tends to keep
a firm hold on the entire solution at once. The purpose of this note is to point out
a compromising procedure which endows shooting-type methods with this particular advantage
of finite difference methods. For such problems, then, all hope need not be abandoned
for shooting methods. This is desirable because shooting methods are generally faster
than finite difference methods.The organization is as follows:  I. The two-point boundary
value problem is stated in quite general form. II. A particular shooting method is
described which is designed to solve the problem in this form. III. The two-point
boundary value problem is then restated in such a way that: (a) the restatement still
falls within the general form, and (b) the shooting method now has a better chance
of success when the equations are unstable.},

@article{Javier2016,
	abstract = { In the future air traffic management system, the trajectory becomes the fundamental element of a new set of operating procedures collectively referred to as trajectory-based operations. Trajectory-based operations require the air traffic management to introduce profound innovations to enable the envisioned changes. Some of these include collaborative decision-making processes, better data and information management, and advanced decision support tools to aid human operators. In particular, fast and accurate computation of optimal trajectories could certainly contribute to enhance trajectory management within the future air traffic management. The trajectory optimization problem can be solved using optimal control methods. In this paper, the existing methods for solving optimal control problems focusing on direct collocation are discussed. In particular, pseudospectral collocation methods have shown to be numerically more accurate and computationally much faster than other direct methods. A very relevant problem arising in air traffic management is analyzed, that is the minimum-fuel trajectory with required time of arrival. Preliminary results illustrate the advantages of using pseudoespectral collocation methods for trajectory optimization in air traffic management; for the same order of numerical accuracy, they present computational times that are at least two orders of magnitude better than other collocation methods. For similar computational times, pseudospectral collocation methods achieve a numerical accuracy that is at least one order of magnitude better than other methods. },

@article{Pierson1989,
	abstract = {Sequential quadratic programming is used to solve several minimum-fuel flight path optimization problems for a point-mass aircraft flying in a vertical plane. Each optimal control problem involves two control functions: a ``steering'' control and a ``thrust'' control. Range is the independent variable. Four dynamic models are examined. The usual point-mass model requires four states (speed, flight path angle, altitude, and mass) and angle of attack as the steering control. An intermediate model with three states (speed, altitude, and mass) neglects the flight path angle dynamics and uses flight path angle as the steering control. An energy-state approximation and a point-mass model including engine dynamics are also treated. Explicit function representations are used to model the aircraft's thrust, lift, and drag characteristics. Numerical solutions are presented for several fuel-optimal transition flight paths between specified states. A comparison of results for the various dynamic models is also given.},

@article{Murrieta2016,
	abstract = {Cruise is normally the longest and most expensive phase in a long-haul flight. Taking advantage of winds to reduce flight time using a constant mach number is of real interest to the aeronautical industry. Reducing flight time will reduce time related costs, help passengers to catch their connections, and reduce fuel consumption. Saving fuel also leads to fewer polluting emissions released to the atmosphere. The ``free-flight'' concept is adopted here, with the search space area modeled as a graph in which the weather information at each vertex is obtained from predictions from Environment Canada. The Floyd-Warshall optimization algorithm was implemented to allow the flight reference trajectory optimization to have automatic decision making capacities to deliver the shortest path trajectory between departure and destination airports. Simulations showed that flight time savings as high as 19 minutes could be obtained, representing (roughly estimated) a savings of 1.2 tons of fuel.},
